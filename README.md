## 🌊 Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python Certification from freeCodeCamp. It explores the analysis of historical sea level data and uses linear regression to predict sea level rise through the year 2050.

## 📊 Objective

Analyze historical sea level data from 1880 to 2013

Use linear regression to calculate the line of best fit

Predict future sea level rise through the year 2050

Visualize the data and predictions using Matplotlib

## 🧪 Tools and Libraries

This project was completed using Python along with the following libraries:

Pandas – for data loading and manipulation

Matplotlib – for creating scatter plots and regression lines

SciPy (linregress) – for performing linear regression analysis

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by freeCodeCamp, originally sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
It includes sea level measurements adjusted by CSIRO.

File Name: epa-sea-level.csv

Columns:

Year – The year of the measurement

CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level – The measured sea level in inches

## 📈 Methodology

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas

Created a scatter plot to visualize original sea level data

Applied linear regression on the full dataset (1880–2013)

Plotted the line of best fit and extended it through 2050 to predict future sea level

(Optional) A second regression line can be added using data from the year 2000 onward for a modern trend comparison

Final output was visualized using Matplotlib, highlighting both historical data and predicted trends

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how historical data can be used to forecast future environmental changes using basic statistical tools like linear regression. It highlights the importance of data visualization in understanding long-term climate trends and makes predictions about the ongoing rise in sea levels through 2050. The project reinforces practical skills in data analysis, regression modeling, and clear graphical presentation using Python.
